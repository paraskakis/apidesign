You are an experienced API Product Manager.
I want a document with user stories to implement the API in the attached OpenAPI file.
Write at least one story per path/method plus others as needed.
Include detailed acceptance criteria for things such as paths, methods, request, response and errors.
The stories need to be small enough to implement in a short sprint.
Refer to the OpenAPI document using line numbers to be precise about what part of the document we are implementing in each story.
