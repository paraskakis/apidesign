# Conference API Market Research

## ICPs
1. **Attendees** who want to browse and plan their schedule at a developer conference.
2. **Speakers** who need to find their room, check their time slot, and see who else is on their track.

## Needs & Pain Points
* Find talks relevant to my interests without scrolling through hundreds of sessions on a spreadsheet or PDF
* Know exactly when and where a talk is happening — conferences are big, rooms are hard to find, schedules change
* See who's speaking, their background, and what else they're presenting — helps prioritize networking
* Last-minute schedule changes (room swaps, cancellations) aren't reflected in the printed program
* No easy way to filter by format — "I only want workshops, not keynotes"

## Benefits

### Attendees
* Walk away better educated — they find the sessions that actually match their skill gaps, not just what's next door
* Connect with the people who have the know-how they need, turning a conference from passive listening into active networking
* The conference is not a waste of time — they maximize the value of their ticket, travel, and days out of the office

### Speakers
* Know exactly where to be and when — no more wandering the venue looking for their room 5 minutes before their talk
* See who else is on their track, making it easier to coordinate and cross-promote sessions

### Industry
* Open access enables third-party apps (schedule builders, digital signage, networking tools) that improve the overall experience
